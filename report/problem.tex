Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a task in which semantic labels for predicates and predicate arguments are assigned to constituents within the syntactic parse of a sentence, and is an approach for extracting meaning from sentences.
Early research on semantic role labeling (SRL) was seen in [Gildea et al, 2002] and [Chen et al, 2003], and after significant manual effort to annotate corpora as training sets, such as PropBank [Kingsbury et al, 2002] and Framenet [Ruppenhofer et al, 2006], machine learning (ML) approaches became common and achieved accuracy close to 80\% [Carreras et al, 2005].
However, portability of trained models to unlabeled corpora remained a problem; even portability within the same domain, e.g. newswire, was poor [Pradhan et al, 2008].
Thus applications and further research on ML approaches was significantly limited by the number and variety of available training corpora, which are expensive to produce.
A low-cost approach to create novel training instances in new corpora, or even corpora in new domains, could increase the applicability and research on ML approaches to SRL.
