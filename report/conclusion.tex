Semantic role labeling is an approach for extracting meaning from sentences, but past machine learning approaches to SRL were limited by the availability of annotated SRL training corpora.  We developed an approach for weak supervision to improve performance on unlabeled corpora while avoiding the expense of developing new training sets.  We evaluated our approach and discussed the issues we encountered and future refinements that should follow from this work.
